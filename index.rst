Project Overview
================

The Cinema Django Site Project aims to recreate the functionalities of
a contemporary cinema website. In today's digital era, an online platform
that offers movie enthusiasts the convenience of browsing movie listings,
checking showtimes, booking tickets, and sharing their reviews is crucial
for any cinema establishment. This platform will also include features
to support user accounts, ensuring a tailored experience for each user.

Purpose and Scope
=================

The purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive online cinema
platform using the Django framework.

The project's scope encompasses:

-   A user-friendly interface for movies and showtimes browsing.
-   Backend functionalities to manage user registration, authentication,
    and ticket booking.
-   A robust data model to cater to movies, user data, bookings, and reviews.
-   Effective security measures to protect user data and ensure the integrity
    of transactions.

The resulting platform should provide users with a seamless online experience,
from selecting a movie to booking a seat, all while ensuring data security and
efficient backend operations.

Functional Requirements
=======================

**Movie Listings**: The platform must display a list of current movies showing,
including relevant details such as movie title, duration, genre, director,
cast, and a brief synopsis.

**Showtimes**: For each movie, users should be able to view available
showtimes, distinguishing between dates and specific time slots.

**Ticket Booking**: Users must have the ability to select a movie, choose
a showtime, and book tickets. This process should include selecting the number
of tickets, choosing seats (if applicable), and confirming the booking.

**User Registration and Authentication**: The platform should offer
a registration process for new users and authentication mechanisms for
returning users. This will allow users to manage their bookings and
leave reviews.

**Reviews and Ratings**: Registered users should be able to leave a review
and rate a movie. Ratings could be on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5 stars).

**Search Functionality**: Users should have the capability to search for
movies by title, director, genre, or cast.

Non-functional Requirements
===========================

**Performance**: The platform should be responsive, ensuring quick loading
times for movie listings, search results, and other user interactions.

**Security**: Sensitive user information, such as passwords and personal
details, must be securely stored. Additionally, security measures should be
in place to prevent malicious attacks, such as SQL injection or Cross-Site
Scripting.

**Scalability**: The platform should be designed in a way that allows it to
handle a growing number of users and movie listings without degradation
in performance.

**Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly,
ensuring that users can easily navigate the platform and complete their
desired actions without confusion.

**Data Integrity**: Measures should be in place to ensure that all data,
especially related to ticket bookings and user accounts, is consistently
accurate and reliable.
